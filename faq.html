        <h1>Printing FAQ</h1>
        <h4>
            What printing size do you recommend?
        </h4>
        <p> We recommend at least A3, for the images to be large enough to color in. 
            In fact, larger is even better, so the best option is to choose 4x A4 (cut and paste), which corresponds more or less to A2.
            If you don't want to cut and paste pages together, you can print larger sizes of the image at your local copyshop. (see copyshop question)
        </p>
        <h4>
            Do I have to change anything in the printer settings menu?
        </h4>
        <p> All you have to do in the printer menu is choosing landscape style printing, and the correct paper size.</p>
        <h4>
            I want to print a larger image at a copyshop.
        </h4>
        <p> That is possible. It is best to give them a pdf. You can get a pdf by choosing scale to A4 or scale to A3 in the top right menu and hitting print.
            Than, in your printer settings menu choose print to file, or a similar option. The file obtained like this should be scaleable to large sizes
            (you can check this by zooming in in the pdf and checking that the lines stay unpixelated).
        </p>
        <h4>
            There is text on my printed page (like page number, website address).
        </h4>
        <p>That's annoying. The good news is, most printer settings menus allow you to turn this off. 
            Look for a setting containing the words header or footer and change it there.
            If this doesn't work or you don't want to reprint the page, you can always take some scissors and cut the text of, as it will always be outside of the actual image.  
        </p>
        <h4>
            How do I cut and paste the images together?
        </h4>
        <p>There are probably different ways to do this, here is mine. What you will need are scissors and glue. </p>
        <ul>
            <li>I lay down the pages in front of me, and start off with the bottom right page. I leave this one whole.</li>
            <li>Then I move to the bottom left page, and cut off the right border on the line. I leave the top border untouched.</li>
            <li>On the bottom right page, I put some glue left of the left border line, and paste the bottom left page on the bottom right one.</li>
            <li>When pasting I check closely that all lines match, and that the border line is invisible.</li>
            <li>Now I move on to the top right page. I cut off the bottom border from this one, leaving the left border untouched. </li>
            <li>I now put glue on the top border of the bottom right page, and paste the top right page on top of it, matching the lines as I go.</li>
            <li>At last I move to the top left page, and cut of both borders.</li>
            <li>I put glue on both the remaining borders, the left one of the top right page and the top one of the bottom left page, and position the top left page on top of it.</li>
        </ul>
        <p>I have never done it before, but I suppose you could also cut of all borders and use tape to paste the pages together. 
            If you want to do it this way, be sure to use the tape on the back, to leave the front colorable.</p>
        <p> If you have a different way of pasting the pages together that works well. Be sure to let me know!</p>
